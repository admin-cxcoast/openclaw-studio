The projects store is persisted as JSON at ~/.clawdbot/agent-canvas/projects.json (src/app/api/projects/store.ts) with manual parsing and minimal validation, and the UI auto-saves every 250ms in src/features/canvas/state/store.tsx without handling save failures. This setup risks silent corruption or data loss when parsing fails or concurrent writes occur.

Introduce a zod schema for ProjectsStore and tile structures, perform validation on load and save, and switch to atomic writes (write temp then rename) with a backup copy when parsing fails. Surface explicit error codes from src/app/api/projects/route.ts, and update the client store to pause autosave and show a blocking error with retry guidance. Touch src/app/api/projects/store.ts, src/app/api/projects/route.ts, src/lib/projects/types.ts, src/lib/http.ts, and src/features/canvas/state/store.tsx.

Acceptance criteria: invalid store files produce actionable errors while preserving the last good file; saves are atomic and verified; the UI shows a clear failure state and does not silently overwrite data; tests cover migration and validation. Open question: how should concurrent writes from multiple tabs/processes be resolved, and do we need a version conflict policy.
